                            Chicken breast is a great source of lean protein (protein without a lot of accompanying fat). People who eat enough
                            protein are more likely to maintain muscle mass and preserve a healthy metabolism. Since chicken breasts
                            are versatile and relatively inexpensive, they are a useful food to include in a balanced, healthy eating plan.<br>
                            The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for one 3-ounce (85g) serving of boneless, skinless grilled
                            chicken breast.1﻿ Note that many commercially packaged chicken breasts are much larger than 3 ounces. So if
                            you eat a single breast, you’re probably eating more than a single serving.</p>

                            Raw chicken can harbor bacteria, such as Campylobacter and Salmonella, that can cause illness. Cooking chicken to at least 165 degrees
                            F will kill the bacteria, but safe handling of the raw meat during preparation isimportant. Never wash or rinse raw chicken, and always
                            thoroughly clean hands, utensils, and surfaces after handling raw chicken.

                            Ground beef is a convenient way to include protein in your diet, and it contains important vitamins and minerals. It is the primary ingredient in many favorite foods from hamburgers to meatballs. But ground beef can be high in calories and saturated fat, and a high intake of red meat can come with health risks. The key to including it in your diet is moderation and managing portion size.
                            The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA for 3 ounces (85g) of cooked ground beef (85% lean), pan-browned, with no added fat or sodium.

                        <p>
                            There is a risk of foodborne bacteria in ground beef as the grinding process can expose more of the meat to any bacteria that are present. The USDA recommends storing ground beef at 40°F or below and using or freezing within two days. To destroy harmful bacteria, always cook ground beef to a minimum internal temperature of 160°F. Avoid partially cooking ground beef, as this allows bacteria to survive and multiply. Use safe food handling practices, such as washing hands, surfaces, and utensils regularly.

                            Sushi has been at the forefront of cuisine for some time now, but a lot of people aren't aware of the nutritional information of sushi. The good news for many is that it is not a particularly fattening food, and there are ways to keep your diet low calorie, even when you are craving sushi.While there are obviously a few calories to be found in rice and eggs, there are a number of variations when it comes to sushi that you can take advantage of. For example, sashimi is raw fish pieces that come without rice, and they are very nutritious and low in calories.
                            While this is just the nutritional information when it comes to a few types of sushi, it gives you an idea of the wide range of healthiness there is between varying kinds. There are ways to ensure that your sushi meal is healthy, however if you are on a plan such as the Calorie King diet there are some obvious choices you need to neglect.
                            Sushi can be an extremely healthy food, especially since fish is so high in protein and omega 3 fatty acids (while also being low in fat). The key here is making educated decisions. Assuming that sushi is healthy on the whole, and consuming a few rolls of shrimp tempura sushi, can knock you right off track when it comes to your weight loss goals. Make sure you know which options are healthy, and make the right choices the next time you head out for a fun filled night of sushi.
